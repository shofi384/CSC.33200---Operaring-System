Task # 6 Explanation


Initially, four pthread_mutex_t mutexes are declared and initailized. They are; 
	lockMutex: It confirms atomicity of the critical section codes both in agent thread and smoker threads
	matchMutex, paperMutex, tobaccoMutex: These mutexes are used to synchronize among smoker threads and the agent thread. 
		It is used to send and receive signal from each smoker threads and agent thread



agentRunner() is activated when agent thread is created. agent thread will activate this function by default	two variables are used to run limited number of iterations; countProduce, maxProduceTimes	while(countProduce < maxProduceTimes) {
		pthread_mutex_lock(&lockMutex);	//acquire lock to perform the following task atomically

		// random number to decide what ingredients to put on the table		randNumber = rand() % 3;	//this random number generator decides what ingredients to be put on the table
		if(randNumber == 0) {	//depending on the random number generated, appropriate smoker thread is waken
			pthread_mutex_unlock(&matchMutex);	// random number==0, means signaling the smoker thread with match to smoke
							// random number==1, means signaling the smoker thread with paper to smoke
							// random number==2, means signaling the smoker thread with tobacco to smoke
			pthread_mutex_unlock(&paperMutex);	//releasing this lock means signaling the appropriate smoker to start smoking 
		//this pattern repeats for maxProduceTimes



void* matchRunner() is activated when smoker thread with match is created. appropriate smoker thread will activate this function by default	while(1) {
		//Acquire matchMutex lock to recieve signal from agent thread to start smoking or in other words, put smoker thread to sleep
		//At every iteration, smoker thread will fall asleep at this point
		//the smoker thread will be sleeping untill agent thread awakens by unlocking the appropriate matchMutex
		pthread_mutex_lock(&matchMutex);
		pthread_mutex_lock(&lockMutex);	//acquire this lock to confirm atomicity and putting agent thread to sleep
							It also prevents other smoker threads to run simultaneously
		... ... ... critical section codes ... ... ...
		pthread_mutex_unlock(&lockMutex);	//atomicity completes by unlocking the lock thus awakens agent thread

	runner() function for other two smokers work identically as described above


int main() {
	//create 4 different threads; one for agent and the other three for smokers:
	agent, match, tobacco, paper e.g:
	iret_paper = pthread_create(&paper, NULL, paperRunner, NULL);
	this will by default activate their appropriate runner() functions

	//initialize each mutex of agent, match, paper, tobacco to 0 e.g: pthread_mutex_lock(&matchMutex);

	//wait for each created thread to exit
	pthread_join(agent, NULL);
	pthread_kill(match, 0);
	pthread_kill(paper, 0);
	pthread_kill(tobacco, 0);

	//the smoker threads are killed instead of being joined to make sure that the smoker threads do not run indefinitely forever
		since we used indefinite while loop (while(1)) in the runner function of each smoker threads
	return 0;
}
